# CVNA_KMX
Carvana vs. CarMax


I looked compared the KMX / CVNA inventory. 

Did a decent job of it, matched on 

Year
Make
Model
Trim 
Milage within 3k miles 

Then choose the one with the closet milage as the match 

almost half of the CVNA inventory matches something on KMX using these criteria 

I'm just so confused. CVNA has the cars for sale, the website is amazing, they're just plain cheaper.... almost across the board. 

They must be directly adjusting their pricing to be 1k less than what they think KMX will charge. It's shockingly regular.
